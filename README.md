# com.chaosspam.audio
Audio manager package for my games so I don't have to copy and paste script everywhere again.

There's no reason for anyone else to use this really it's not good.


## Notes for self
Grab package from 

`https://github.com/chaosspam/com.chaosspam.audio.git#upm`

Push update to branch

`git subtree push --prefix "Assets/Chao Audio Manager" origin upm`
